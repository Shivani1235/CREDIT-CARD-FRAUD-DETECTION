Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Problem Statement
In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.

Suppose you are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. You need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. You can learn more about transactional data and the creation of historical variables from the link attached here. You may find this helpful in the capstone project while building the fraud detection model. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.
